---My answer---

Input: String
Output: Array of strings, or empty

Rules: 
  Expilcit requirements:
    - all palindrome substrings should be returned
    - palindromes are case sensitive ("Dad" is not a palindrome, but "dad" is.)

  Implicit requirements:
    - The output should be an array of string(s)
    - If there aren't any palindromes, the output should be an empty array.
    - If the input is an empty string, the output should be an empty array.


---LS answer---
# Some questions you might have?
# 1. What is a substring?
# 2. What is a palindrome?
# 3. Will inputs always be strings?
# 4. What does it mean to treat palindrome words case-sensitively?

# input: string
# output: an array of substrings
# rules:
#      Explicit requirements:
#        - return only substrings which are palindromes.
#        - palindrome words should be case sensitive, meaning "abBA"
#          is not a palindrome.
